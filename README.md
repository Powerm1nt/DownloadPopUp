## Configuration

### Downloads links setup
> For setup the needed downloads links for the ui, you need to edit a json file located on ``/config/dllinks.json``.  

#### This is a example file of ``dllinks.json`` :

```json
{
  "x86_64": "https://example.com/public/installers/current/x86_64/Setup_x86_64.exe",
  "x86": "https://example.com/public/installers/current/x86/Setup_x86.exe",
  "universal" : "https://example.com/public/dists/current/dist.jar"
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ You need to understand theses points :  
    - The key name corresponds to the runnable file for right CPU architecture.  
    - The value is the link which points to the program.
